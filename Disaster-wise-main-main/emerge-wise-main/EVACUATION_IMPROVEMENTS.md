# Evacuation Destination Search Improvements

## Problem Fixed
The quick evacuation destinations (hospitals, police stations, etc.) were showing locations very far away from the user instead of the nearest ones.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Multi-Strategy Search Approach
- **Strategy 1**: Overpass API for most accurate OpenStreetMap data
- **Strategy 2**: Nominatim with bounded search (5km radius)
- **Strategy 3**: Nominatim with proximity search (10km radius)
- **Strategy 4**: Generic search as last resort (25km radius)

### 2. Improved Search Queries
- Added Indian-specific terms (e.g., "chowki", "thana" for police stations)
- More comprehensive search terms for each destination type
- Better filtering for relevant results

### 3. Enhanced Distance Calculation
- Accurate Haversine formula for distance calculation
- Results sorted by actual distance from user location
- Distance displayed in meters for nearby locations (<1km)

### 4. New Destination Types Added
- **Airport**: For major evacuations
- **Safe Zone/Park**: Open spaces for temporary shelter
- Better categorization with color-coded buttons

### 5. Better User Experience
- Loading indicators for each destination type
- Clear error messages and fallback options
- Visual feedback with color-coded destination types
- Improved button layout (2x3x4 grid responsive)

### 6. Robust Error Handling
- Multiple fallback strategies if primary search fails
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Clear user feedback for all scenarios

## Technical Details

### Search Radius Strategy
1. **Primary**: 5km radius for most accurate results
2. **Secondary**: 10km radius for broader search
3. **Fallback**: 25km radius for emergency situations

### API Usage
- **Overpass API**: Most accurate for OpenStreetMap amenity data
- **Nominatim**: Reliable fallback with good coverage
- **No API keys required**: Uses free, open-source services

### Performance Optimizations
- Concurrent search strategies with proper error handling
- Results cached and sorted by distance
- Timeout handling for slow network conditions

## Usage
1. Enable GPS location for best results
2. Click any destination button to find the nearest one
3. System automatically calculates evacuation route
4. Multiple route options provided when available

## Testing
Test with different locations to verify:
- Nearby destinations are found correctly
- Distance calculations are accurate
- Fallback strategies work when primary search fails
- All destination types return relevant results
