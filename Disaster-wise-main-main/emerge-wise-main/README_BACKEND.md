## üîÑ Real-time Features

### Socket.IO Events

**Client ‚Üí Server:**
- `join_location` - Join location-based room
- `join_role` - Join role-based room
- `report_incident` - Report new incident
- `update_resource_status` - Update resource availability
- `update_route_status` - Update evacuation route
- `create_alert` - Create emergency alert
- `request_dashboard_data` - Request latest stats

**Server ‚Üí Client:**
- `new_emergency_alert` - New alert created
- `high_severity_incident` - Critical incident reported
- `resource_updated` - Resource status changed
- `route_status_updated` - Route status changed
- `capacity_warning` - Resource at high capacity
- `traffic_updates` - Route traffic conditions
- `emergency_notification` - Emergency broadcast
- `dashboard_data` - Real-time statistics

## ü§ñ AI Features

### Severity Calculation
The AI system analyzes incidents based on:
- Incident type (earthquake, flood, fire, etc.)
- Description keywords (critical, severe, massive, etc.)
- Location density (major cities get higher scores)
- Historical patterns

### Resource Prediction
Automatically predicts required resources:
- Medical teams needed
- Fire department units
- Police units required
- Shelter capacity
- Estimated affected population

### Risk Assessment
Evaluates location-based risks:
- Flood risk by geography
- Earthquake vulnerability
- Fire hazard levels
- Weather-related risks

## üìä Dashboard Enhancements
